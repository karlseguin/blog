<p>I like the design of my blog. I especially like that every post I've written shows up on the home page, without having to page. Of course, that means that the more I write, the slower my home page will load.</p>

<p>I've tweaked things out a bit, but I've reached my HTML limits. Can you help?</p>

<p>Since the bulk is repetitive, I realize JavaScript could be leveraged. As an extreme example, the <code>href</code> could be omitted and generated via JavaScript from the title + date. But this has accessibility problems, so I'm not too keen.</p>

<p>The page is pre-generated by Jekyll. You can <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin/karlseguin.github.com/blob/master/index.html">see the source on github.</a> But, just view-sourcing the page should be good enough. Can you help?</p>
