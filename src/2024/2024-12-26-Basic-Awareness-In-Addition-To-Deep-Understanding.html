<p>Software developers are often evaluated based on how well they understand specific ideas and tools. While mastery <em>is</em> important, there's another type of knowledge I find myself relying on: vague awareness. Unlike mastery, awareness is merely knowing that something exists along with a basic understanding of what it is and what problem it can solve.</p>

<p>For example, I love regular expressions and, within reason, I'm pretty comfortable with them. But I only have a vague understanding of <a href="/2011/2/16/Regex-Positive-Negative-Look-Ahead-Behind/">positive and negative lookahead and lookbehind expressions</a>. I certainly don't know the exact syntax, but I do know it isn't something every regular expression engine supports. Importantly, I know that it has something to do with matching without consuming the match / non-match. Given a problem, I think I understand it well enough to be able to identify these fancy expressions as a possible solution.</p>

<p>Another example is the SQL lead/lag window functions. In fact, when it comes to SQL, there's probably a lot of examples I could pick (lateral joins, recursive CTEs). But I particularly like this example because (a) they're super useful and (b) they remind me that there's a bunch of windowing functions I don't remember.</p>

<p>The list of things I hardly know is long. Bash, systemd, memory mapped files, io_uring, Makefile, DNS, UDP, etc. But when the tools I <em>have</em> mastered either don't apply or aren't well suited to a specific problem, I hopefully know these well enough to jumpstart finding a good solution.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons I blog. I find that I retain things better when I write about them. You couldn't tell from all the typos and spelling errors, but I'll re-read my blog posts 3-4 times before publishing. That act of writing and reading help me retain the information. It's also a good reference to my future self. More than once I've used my blog to learn something I once understood better. It's probably universally true that the way we explain things to others is the way we want things explained to us.</p>
