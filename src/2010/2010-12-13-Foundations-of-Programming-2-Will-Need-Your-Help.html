title: "Foundations of Programming 2 Will Need Your Help"
---
<p>I'm writing a follow up to the original Foundations of Programming, and I could use your help. For those who don't know, the original was released as a series of blog posts and then compiled into the pdf/word doc. The comments and feedback from the blog articles made a huge difference in the quality of the finished product. I'd very much like to repeat that process.</p>

<p>The plan is simple. Over the next couple months I'll release chapters of the Foundations of Programming 2 on my blog as well as on <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin/Foundations-of-Programming-2">github</a> at regular intervals. I'll take help in every shape or form - you can email me, leave a comment on the blog, or use the various github facilities to get changes to me.</p>

<p>Typos and grammatical fixes are most appreciated - they aren't my strong suit and I'm using tools with weaker dictionaries this time around. General feedback on code, content or whatever would also be great - I'm learning as much as I'm teaching. Think I'm wrong or missing an angle or should talk about something I didn't cover? I want to hear about it.  Cover art? Conversion to PDF? Anything!</p>

<p>The book will be around the same length as the original (looking a bit shorter at this point to be honest) and more language agnostic. Also, the entire process shouldn't drag on like the original. It'll be written in Markdown and it'll be free.</p>
